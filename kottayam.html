                            <p>
                                Located at a height of 6000 ft above the sea level in the Western Ghats of Kottayam, Kerala, Illikkal Kallu is a major tourist attraction and one of the most pristine spots in all of India. Situated in Moonnilavu Village, Meenachil taluk, the nearest city to the summit is Teekoy. Besides several other factors which make this peak unique, the most prominent feature is that half the boulder of the majestic rock has fallen apart. The remaining half stands sturdy and presents an extremely exalted picture. Surrounded by colossal green hills, the offbeat destination boasts of immaculate environs, enchanting panoramic vistas and an all around utopian atmosphere. In addition to the surreal natural beauty, the sublime view of the Arabian Sea in the near horizon as a thin blue stroke, is a sight beyond description.

                            <h5>Vaikom</h5>
                            <p>
                                Vaikom is a town located in the district of Kottayam in Kerala. It was also a destination of Satyagraha during the Indian Independence Movement. It is the oldest city in Kottayam and lies very close to the famous tourist spot of Kumarakom. Vaikom Temple lies at the heart of the town and becomes very prominent during its Vaikom Ashtami celebrations during the month of November. This temple was constructed in the year 1594. It is also enclosed by a courtyard which is spread across 8 acres of land.

                                The history of Vaikom can be traced back to the time when there existed a kingdom known as Venmalanadu of which Vaikom is a part. Later, Venmalanadu was broken down into Vadakkumkoor and Thekkumkoor. Vaikom became a part of the dynasty of Vadakkumkoor.

                                In 1742, Vaikom became a part of the Travancore after the Maharaja of Travancore took over Vadakkumkoor and merged it into his kingdom. However, Vaikom became famous due to the Satyagraha which was held in there during the Indian Independence Movement. It has a population of approximately 22637 and a literacy rate of 92%.
